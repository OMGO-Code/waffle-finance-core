/**
 * @file route-policy.ts
 *
 * Central route-policy guard for the coordinator.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists
 *
 * The coordinator's announcement validation previously checked that a
 * direction's declared src/dst chains were internally consistent (e.g.
 * `eth_to_xlm` must name `ethereum` as srcChain and `stellar` as dstChain).
 * That is a *format* check. It does not answer a different, equally important
 * question: **is this route actually supported end-to-end right now?**
 *
 * Without a policy boundary, the order pipeline silently accepts combinations
 * that can never settle:
 *   - Directions whose destination chain has no settlement code path (Solana
 *     placeholder status means no relayer or resolver can complete the leg).
 *   - Same-chain "bridges" that are structurally valid but semantically
 *     meaningless.
 *   - Unknown chain identifiers that pass Zod enum validation but have no
 *     operational meaning.
 *
 * This module provides a single `checkRoutePolicy` function that evaluates
 * every such constraint at the policy boundary and returns a typed
 * `RouteVerdict`. Both the Zod schema refinement (`announceSchema`) and any
 * future middleware layer call the same function so the policy is never
 * duplicated.
 *
 * ## The model
 *
 * A route is the combination of (direction, srcChain, dstChain). A verdict is
 * either `{ allowed: true }` or `{ allowed: false, code, reason, field? }`.
 * The `code` is a stable machine-readable identifier suitable for metrics and
 * operator tooling. The `reason` is a human-readable explanation that appears
 * verbatim in HTTP 400 responses and logs.
 *
 * ## Solana placeholder awareness
 *
 * Solana appears in the `Direction` enum (`eth_to_sol`, `sol_to_eth`) because
 * the contracts and SDK routes are declared, but no settlement path is
 * implemented yet. The policy explicitly blocks these directions at the
 * coordinator boundary rather than letting orders reach the observation or
 * reconciliation layers where they would silently stall.
 *
 * The same mechanism handles any future chain that is declared but not yet
 * operational: add it to `PLACEHOLDER_CHAINS` and it is automatically blocked
 * with a clear operator-facing message.
